# Savior_an_Intelligent_Security_System_App

I am introducing an Artificial Intelligence-based mobile application “Savior” which runs in both Android and iOS operating systems. It is an intelligent
security system that operates its work with its intelligence. Savior assists the user by phoning the emergency number, sending a message to the emergency number with the user’s current
location in the form of latitude and longitude, displaying battery information, monitoring live location, as well as Savior can run all its features with the user’s voice commands.
